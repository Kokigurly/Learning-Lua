 -- Non strings 
All non-string types (such as numbers) should be converted into strings when printing them. 
local age = 24
print(tostring(age)) – Although it is usually okay to print number types, as they seem to be automatically casted to strings. The Type Checker might not like this, though.
 
-- Addition with strings
Instead of using + when combining strings, you use ..
print(age..name)


 -- Datatypes: 
Nil = nothing/empty - it doesn’t exist
Number = -5, 4, 1 
String = text, for instance (“Hello world”)
Boolean = true/false 
Tables = lists 

 -- Chunks: 
A sequence of statements 
    a = 1
    b = a*2
    
    a = 1;
    b = a*2;
    
    a = 1 ; b = a*2
    
    a = 1   b = a*2
Everything above generates the same results 

 -- Interactive mode 
After each command that you type executes immediately after you press <enter> 
To exit the interpreter and the interactive mode - type end-of-file or use the exit function (os.exit()<enter>)

-- Linking chunks with files using the stand-alone interpreter 
Option 1: -1 --> calls the require function 
file a - x=1
file b - print(x)
prompt > lua -1a -1b 
This will execute the code of oth those files as they "work together" and will give 1 

Option 2: -i --> interactive session 
prompt > -i -1a -1b --> it will prompt you for interaction (debugging and manual testing) 

Option 3: dofile function --> immediately executes a file
